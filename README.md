# Description
This protocol is used for pseudouridine (psU, Î¨) prediction of nanopore RNA direct sequencing data. There is no minimum input reads requirement but a raw dataset of >1M reads is recommended for the following processing for human transcriptome. For a larger transcriptome, more reads are recommended.

This protocol is tested on a cluster of linux system ("midway2", Scientific Linux 7.2).

# Protocol
## 1. Base call
You could base call the reads during sequencing. If so, this step is not necessary. If the data is not base called, use the following command to do the base call.
```bash
guppy_basecaller --input_path fast5 \
                 --recursive \
                 --save_path fastq \
                 --records_per_fastq 0 \
                 --flowcell FLO-MIN106 \
                 --kit SQK-RNA002 \
                 --qscore_filtering \
                 --min_qscore 7 \
                 --cpu_threads_per_caller 3 \
                 --num_callers 5
```
"Input_path" is the path of your raw data. "Save_path" is your output folder. "Flowcell" is the type of nanopore flowcell you use. "Kit" is the version of nanopore direct RNA sequencing kit you use. Customize "cpu_threads_per_caller" and "num_caller" according to the state of your own cluster. This step is computation intensive.

## 2. Alignment and pile up
```bash
python alignment.py fastq/pass/ GRCh38.p13.genome.fa
```
The first argument is the input fastq path. The second argument is the genome reference file.
The output is a folder "alignment" with two subfolders. The two subfolders contains data of reads aligned to forward and reverse strands respectively. This step is computation intensive.

## 3. Feature extraction
Due to the design of samtools. In the mpileup files, the split reads will be filled a ">" or "<" in the jumped regions and the coverage and the quality score are affected. Run the following script to remove the intron gap sections in the mpileup file. This step is computation intensive.
```bash
python remove_intron.py
```
Then extract 12 features of all U sites. This step is computation intensive.
```bash
python extract_features.py
```
The output file is "features.csv" in the "alignment" folder.

## 4. psU prediction
Make sure that the "model_3_0.pkl" file is in your current folder which contains the "alignment" folder. Then run the following script.
```bash
python3 prediction.py
```
The output file is the "prediction.csv" in the "alignment" folder. Each row contains the reference strand, position, base type, coverage, U probability and psU probability.
